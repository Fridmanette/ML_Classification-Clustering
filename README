This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of an automobile company's customer segmentation strategy. The objective is to 
evaluate the applicability of an existing segmentation model to a new market using machine learning and clustering techniques

Machine Learning Approaches
1. Classification Models:
- Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, AdaBoost), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, and Learning Curves.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Conducted using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters.

3. Class Imbalance Handling:
- Techniques: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), RandomUnderSampler, and Class Weights.

4. Clustering:
- Applied K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering for alternative segmentation.
- Visualized clusters using t-SNE and dendrograms.
- Evaluated clustering quality using Silhouette Scores.

Tools and Technologies
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SMOTE
- Clustering: K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, t-SNE, Dendrograms
